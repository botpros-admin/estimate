# Paint Estimator App - Mobile UI Fixes Continuation

## Project Overview
You are working on a paint estimator web application that has recently undergone mobile UI improvements. The previous AI assistant (that's me!) made significant progress fixing mobile toggle buttons and multi-select dropdowns, but there are three remaining issues to fix.

## Project Details
- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/botpros-admin/estimate
- **Local Repository Path:** `C:\Users\Agent\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\app-0.11.6\estimate-paint-app`
- **Current Branch:** `fix/mobile-toggles-and-ui-improvements` (already created and pushed)
- **Local Server Command:** `cd C:\Users\Agent\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\app-0.11.6\estimate-paint-app; python -m http.server 8000`
- **Test URL:** http://localhost:8000/pages/project-info.html

## What Was Already Fixed
1. ✅ Mobile toggle buttons (Interior/Exterior) - now work with single tap
2. ✅ Replaced all "Abrasive Cleaning" with "Cleaning"
3. ✅ Removed search inputs from multi-select dropdowns (partially - see issue #1 below)
4. ✅ Removed blue outline on mobile devices

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Service Type Dropdown Shows Blank
The Service Type dropdown is showing up blank when clicked. The other dropdowns (Surface Coating Method, Cleaning Method) work fine. Need to investigate why Service Type specifically isn't populating.

### Issue 2: All Dropdowns Auto-Open on Page Refresh
When the page is refreshed, all multi-select dropdowns automatically open/expand. They should remain closed until the user clicks them.

### Issue 3: Contact Placeholder Text
The contact input field currently shows placeholder text "Contact name, phone or email" but it should only say "Full Name".
- File: `pages/project-info.html`
- Element: `<input type="text" placeholder="Contact name, phone or email" class="crm-entity-widget-content-input crm-entity-widget-content-search-input" autocomplete="nope">`

## Technical Context

### Key Files You'll Be Working With:
1. **pages/project-info.html** - Main page with all the form elements
2. **js/components/multi-select.js** - Multi-select dropdown component
3. **js/fixes/mobile-scope-toggle-fix.js** - Mobile toggle button fixes (already working great)
4. **css/multi-select.css** - Styles for multi-select dropdowns

### Recent Changes Made to multi-select.js:
- Modified to hide search inputs when `noSearch` option is true
- Used opacity:0 and off-screen positioning instead of display:none
- Added `renderDropdown('')` call for no-search dropdowns

### Important Implementation Details:
- The app uses vanilla JavaScript (no React/Vue)
- Multi-select dropdowns are custom components initialized with `data-multi-select="true"`
- Service Type dropdown has `data-no-search="true"` attribute
- Use Desktop Commander MCP for all file operations
- Always restart the server after making changes

## Working Style & Best Practices
1. **Use Desktop Commander (DC) for everything** - The user specifically wants you to use the MCP tools
2. **Always restart the server** after making changes using:
   - Kill existing: `desktop-commander:force_terminate` or `taskkill /F /IM node.exe`
   - Start new: `cd C:\Users\Agent\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\app-0.11.6\estimate-paint-app; python -m http.server 8000`
3. **Be thorough with code blocks** - Never omit anything in code blocks
4. **Test your changes** - Verify fixes work before committing
5. **Keep the same helpful, detailed communication style**

## Git Workflow
- You're already on branch: `fix/mobile-toggles-and-ui-improvements`
- After fixing these issues, add files, commit, and push
- The user will create the PR manually on GitHub

## Debugging Tips
1. For Service Type dropdown issue, check:
   - Is the dropdown data properly initialized?
   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify the `data-items` attribute is properly formatted
   
2. For auto-open dropdowns issue:
   - Look for initialization code that might be adding 'active' class
   - Check if `renderDropdown('')` is being called too early
   
3. For placeholder text:
   - Simple find/replace in project-info.html
   - Make sure to update all instances

## Success Criteria
1. Service Type dropdown shows "Surface Coating" and "Cleaning" options when clicked
2. All dropdowns remain closed on page load/refresh
3. Contact field placeholder says only "Full Name"
4. No new bugs introduced
5. Clean commit with descriptive message

Good luck! The user has been very happy with the progress so far. Maintain the same attention to detail and helpful communication style. Remember to use Desktop Commander for all file operations and always restart the server after changes!
