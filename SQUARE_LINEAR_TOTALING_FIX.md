# Square vs Linear Totaling Fix

## Issue Description
Linear foot measurements were being incorrectly added to the square foot total instead of being tracked separately.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Calculation Logic (`calculateAndUpdateStateAreas`)
- **Before**: Single `totalSurfaceArea` variable combined all measurements
- **After**: Separate tracking with `totalSquareArea` and `totalLinearArea`
- Added logic to categorize measurements based on `calculationType` property
- Both dimension (L×H) and total area measurements can now be either square or linear

### 2. Updated Surface Data Structure
- Added `calculatedTotalSquareArea` property
- Added `calculatedTotalLinearArea` property  
- Maintained `calculatedTotalArea` for backward compatibility (uses square area)

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **Before**: Single "Calculated Total Section Area (Sq Ft)" display
- **After**: Two separate displays:
  - "Calculated Total Section Area (Sq Ft)"
  - "Calculated Total Linear Footage"
- Square/Linear toggle now available for both dimension and total modes

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Total input placeholder updates based on calculation type:
  - Square mode: "Enter total area"
  - Linear mode: "Enter total linear footage"
- Button text updates dynamically:
  - Square mode: "Add L x H Pair"
  - Linear mode: "Add Linear Dimension"

## Files Modified

### `js/consolidated/paint-surfaces-combined.js`
1. **`calculateAndUpdateStateAreas()` function**
   - Added separate tracking for square vs linear measurements
   - Enhanced logic to handle `calculationType` for both dimension and total measurements

2. **`updateDisplayedCalculations()` function**
   - Added update logic for both square and linear total displays
   - Maintained backward compatibility

3. **Surface card creation**
   - Modified total area display section to show both totals
   - Added CSS classes for separate total value elements

4. **Square/Linear toggle behavior**
   - Toggle now always visible (removed conditional display)
   - Added placeholder text updates for total input
   - Enhanced toggle handler to support total mode

## Test File Created
- `test/square-linear-totaling-test.html` - Demonstrates the fix with interactive examples

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing measurements default to "square" calculation type
- Old `calculatedTotalArea` property still maintained
- All existing functionality preserved

## Key Benefits
1. ✅ Linear measurements no longer contaminate square foot totals
2. ✅ Clear separation between square feet and linear footage
3. ✅ Enhanced user experience with appropriate placeholders and labels
4. ✅ Supports both calculation types in dimension and total modes
5. ✅ Maintains full backward compatibility

## Testing
Run the test file to verify:
1. Square measurements contribute only to square foot total
2. Linear measurements contribute only to linear footage total
3. Toggle works in both dimension and total modes
4. Placeholder text updates correctly
5. Both totals display properly in the UI
